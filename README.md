Castle Apartments is a full-featured real estate web application developed as a practical project for the university course. This project was created to demonstrate skills in full-stack web development, database design, and user experience â€” it is an academic exercise and not a commercial or real-world product.

The application is built using Django as the backend framework, PostgreSQL as the database engine, and Python as the core programming language. It offers a clean, responsive interface that simplifies property browsing, purchase offers, and transaction finalization.
